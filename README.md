# Simple Task Manager

This is a lightweight Task Manager application built using **C#** and **Visual Studio**. It provides users with the ability to monitor and manage currently running processes on their Windows system. The application also includes an option to restart the Windows Explorer process (`explorer.exe`), making it especially useful for troubleshooting issues with the Windows desktop environment.

## Features

- **Process Management**: View a list of currently running processes, their IDs, and memory usage.
- **End Processes**: Terminate any unresponsive or unnecessary processes.
- **Restart Windows Explorer**: Easily restart `explorer.exe` if your desktop or taskbar is behaving abnormally.
- **Dark Mode UI**: A clean and modern user interface with a dark theme and a visually appealing design.
- **Resizable Window**: Fully resizable layout to fit any screen size.

## Why I Created This

A while back, I encountered a recurring issue with my system where the **Windows Explorer** would frequently freeze, making it impossible to interact with the taskbar or desktop. This required me to open the default Windows Task Manager, locate `explorer.exe`, terminate it, and then manually restart it. While this workaround worked, I found it cumbersome to perform repeatedly.

Additionally, I wanted to create a simple but powerful tool that focused on process management without the complexity of the default Task Manager. This project was born as a practical solution to my problem, allowing me to handle unresponsive processes and quickly restart Windows Explorer with a single button click.

## How It Works

1. **Process Viewer**: The application uses the `System.Diagnostics` namespace to fetch and display all currently running processes.
   - A `DataGridView` displays the processes in a tabular format, including columns for Process Name, ID, and Memory Usage.

2. **End Process**: Selecting a process from the list and clicking the "End Process" button will terminate the selected process using the `Kill` method.

3. **Restart Explorer**: The "Restart Explorer" button is programmed to:
   - Locate all instances of `explorer.exe`.
   - Kill the process and wait for it to exit.
   - Restart `explorer.exe` to restore the Windows desktop environment.

4. **UI Enhancements**:
   - A dark mode theme with custom colors to provide a modern and visually pleasing experience.
   - Smooth resizing and adaptive layout to make the application user-friendly on any screen size.
   - Hover effects and selection highlights to improve usability.

## Future Improvements

- Add CPU and disk usage monitoring for each process.
- Implement search and filtering options for the process list.
- Support additional system management features, such as launching new processes.
